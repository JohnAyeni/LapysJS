# Quick Start
Several quick start options are available:
- Clone or download the source files from GitHub.

# Status
Still under development but feasible to test with.

# What's Included
Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```
    LapysJS/
    ├── lapys.css
    ├── lapys.min.css
    ├── lapys.js
    ├── lapys.min.js
```

We provide compiled CSS and JS (`lapys.*`), as well as minified CSS and JS (`lapys.min.*`).
